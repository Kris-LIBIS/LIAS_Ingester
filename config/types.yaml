# This file lists all the types the application is knows about along with its mime type and file extensions.
# The first file extension in the list is the default one that will be used when a file of that type is created.
# The mime types need to be unique. Some mime types need to be 'invented' like for instance for PDF/A. The MimeType
# class should take care of that.
# Preferably the file extensions are unique too. If not, the first matching entry in the list will be used when a
# reverse lookup from extension to type identifier is performed. However, file extensions will typically not be used
# to determine type identifier or mime types. So you should be fairly safe when the file extensions are not unique.
